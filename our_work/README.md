# ETH Quantum Hackathon 2025 ‚Äî Alice & Bob Challenge

This repository contains our solution to the Alice & Bob quantum state tomography challenge. We focus on reconstructing quantum states from Wigner function measurements, using both analytical tools and machine learning methods for denoising and analysis.
